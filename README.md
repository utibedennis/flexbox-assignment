## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS flexbox and media queries.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build the design image displayed in the images folder.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Where to find everything

You will find all the required assets in the /images folder. The assets are already optimized.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on GitHub. This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, have a read through of this Try Git resource.
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using netlify.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using netflify as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with.

3. Sign up to netlify and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their netlify for GitHub integration.
4. Connect your project to netlify from the "Import project" page, using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
   Once connected, every time you git push, netlify will create a new deployment and the deployment URL will be shown on your Dashboard.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
